# IMSTE

**Iterated Minimum Spanning Tree Embedding (IMSTE)** is a scikit-learn
transformer for learning low-dimensional coordinates from numeric data. It
builds a weighted graph from edge-disjoint minimum spanning trees, then
optimizes one coordinate vector per sample.

The package has two explicit estimators: `IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder`
learns coordinates for the training rows, while `InductiveIMSTE` also learns
an MLP that maps new rows into that space.

## Install

From a source checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

For notebooks, install the optional plotting and widget dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install ".[notebook]"
```

The default sparse approximate FAMST graph builder uses PyNNDescent, which is
installed with the package. To use only the exact Prim builder, select
`mst_method="prim"`.

## Quick start

IMSTE uses Euclidean distances to build its graph. Scale features first when
they have different ranges. This small example uses scikit-learn's built-in
digits dataset, so it does not need a download:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from imste import IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder

digits = load_digits()
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
rows = rng.choice(len(digits.data), size=500, replace=False)
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(digits.data[rows])

mapper = IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder(
    n_msts=5,
    n_epochs=300,
    random_state=42,
)
embedding = mapper.fit_transform(X)

print(embedding.shape)  # (500, 2)
```

For larger datasets, FAMST is the default sparse approximate builder. To use
the exact Prim builder instead, set `mst_method="prim"`:

```python
mapper = IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder(
    n_msts=5,
    mst_method="famst",
    mst_neighbors=15,
    mst_inter_component_edges=5,
    random_state=42,
)
embedding = mapper.fit_transform(X)
```

FAMST starts with an approximate k-nearest-neighbor graph, adds and refines
connections between disconnected components, then extracts edge-disjoint trees
from that sparse candidate graph. It samples up to
`mst_representatives_per_component` points from each component, builds an exact
MST over those representatives, and searches bridge candidates only for the
unique component pairs crossed by that MST. The default representative cap is
10. FAMST can increase the neighbor count when needed, up to
`mst_max_neighbors` (by default, four times `mst_neighbors`). The result is
approximate and is not guaranteed to match the trees from the complete
Euclidean graph. The sparse mode also samples negative pairs without allocating
the core estimator's quadratic adjacency bit matrix.
The implementation follows Almansoori and Telek's
[FAMST paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14261).

The labels are not passed to the estimator. Use them afterward to color or
score a visualization if needed.

## How it works

### Build a graph

The estimator computes pairwise Euclidean distances, constructs `n_msts`
edge-disjoint minimum spanning trees, and joins their edges into one graph.
An edge selected in tree rank `r` receives weight `1 / r`, so edges from later
trees contribute less to attraction.

### Optimize coordinates

The embedding objective uses squared Euclidean distances. For an embedded pair
`i, j`, let `d² = sum((y_i - y_j) ** 2)`. Graph edges use logarithmic
attraction, `log1p(d² + epsilon)`. Sampled non-edges use logistic repulsion,
`softplus((logistic_margin - d²) / logistic_temperature)`.

`lambda_rep` sets the repulsion share of the objective; attraction receives
`1 - lambda_rep`. Positive edge losses are normalized by the total graph-edge
weight. Negative losses use an unweighted mean. Each positive edge contributes
`negative_ratio` sampled non-neighbors from each endpoint.

The default `mst_method="famst"` builds an approximate sparse graph. It can
increase the neighbor count as needed, subject to `mst_max_neighbors`. Select
`mst_method="prim"` for exact edge-disjoint trees from dense pairwise
distances, which use quadratic time and memory in the number of samples.

## Choose how to transform rows

### Transductive: training rows only

Use the core estimator when you want optimized coordinates for the fitted
rows. Its `transform` accepts only the exact training matrix in its original
row order; it raises an error for new or reordered rows.

```python
from imste import IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder

mapper = IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder(n_msts=10).fit(X_train)
Z_train = mapper.transform(X_train)
```

### Inductive: map new rows with an MLP

Import `InductiveIMSTE` from the explicit `imste.inductive` module. It fits a
transductive IMSTE embedding, then trains an MLP to predict those coordinates:

```python
from imste import IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder
from imste.inductive import InductiveIMSTE

mapper = InductiveIMSTE(
    embedder=IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder(
        n_msts=10,
        random_state=42,
    ),
    n_layers=6,
    layer_size=128,
    dropout=0.1,
    min_epochs=100,
    patience=20,
).fit(X_train)

Z_train = mapper.transform(X_train)  # MLP predictions for training rows
Z_new = mapper.transform(X_new)      # MLP predictions for new rows
Z_reference = mapper.reference_embedding_  # exact optimized IMSTE coordinates
```

`InductiveIMSTE.transform` always uses the MLP, including for training rows.
Its `reference_embedding_` contains the exact transductive coordinates that
serve as MLP targets. The MLP standardizes its inputs and targets, holds out
10% of the input rows for validation, and restores the checkpoint with the
best validation loss. The IMSTE coordinates use all input rows; the validation
split only controls MLP early stopping. Predictions approximate the reference
embedding and do not extend or re-optimize its graph.
