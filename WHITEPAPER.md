# IMSTE: Iterated Minimum Spanning Tree Embedding

## Abstract

Iterated Minimum Spanning Tree Embedding (IMSTE) is an unsupervised method for
placing a finite set of high-dimensional observations in a lower-dimensional
coordinate space. It builds a weighted graph by repeatedly finding a minimum
spanning tree (MST) and removing its edges before finding the next tree. The
union of these edge-disjoint trees supplies an adaptive set of relationships:
early trees preserve the shortest connections, while later trees add longer
connections that help describe broader structure. A rank-based weight controls
the influence of each tree. The graph is then embedded by optimizing an
attractive loss on graph edges together with a sampled repulsive loss on
non-edges.

The method is deliberately direct. It uses Euclidean distances, a dense MST
construction, and a small differentiable objective. It does not use class
labels, a nearest-neighbor graph, or an out-of-sample projection. This paper
describes the implementation in this repository and its practical limits; it
makes no claim that the method is a drop-in replacement for established
embedding methods.

## 1. Motivation and scope

An embedding aims to represent relationships among observations with fewer
coordinates than the original feature space. IMSTE represents those
relationships through a sequence of spanning trees. The first tree connects
each sample to the dataset through the shortest possible total edge length.
After its edges are removed, the next tree must use different connections.
Repeating this process exposes additional relationships without choosing a
fixed number of nearest neighbors for every point.

The estimator is intended for exploratory visualization and geometric
inspection of a fixed dataset. Its output is a learned coordinate for each
training row. The current implementation does not define coordinates for new,
unseen rows.

## 2. Notation

Let the input be a matrix

$$
X = [x_1,\ldots,x_n]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p},
$$

In the matrix dimensions, n is the number of samples and p is the number of
features.

Each sample receives a coordinate in the embedding space, where the output
dimension is q:

$$
y_i \in \mathbb{R}^q.
$$

The number of trees is R.

## 3. Graph construction

The method computes all pairwise Euclidean distances:

$$
D_{ij}=\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{p}(x_{ik}-x_{jk})^2}.
$$

For each requested rank, the method finds an MST over the remaining available
edges, adds the tree's edges to the embedding graph, and removes those edges
in both directions. Thus no undirected edge appears in more than one tree.
An edge first selected at rank $r$ receives the fixed inverse-rank weight:

$$
w_{ij}=\frac{1}{r}.
$$

The edge weight depends on its tree rank, not on a separately applied distance
decay.

When all requested trees can be constructed, the resulting graph contains:

$$
|E|=R(n-1).
$$

If removing earlier trees disconnects the available graph, fitting stops with
an error asking for fewer trees. The implementation uses dense Prim
construction with an explicit edge-availability mask. This allows distinct
samples at zero distance to remain valid MST edges.

## 4. Coordinate objective

Each sample receives a trainable coordinate, initialized with small Gaussian
noise and stored as a contiguous float32 array. A Numba-compiled SGD kernel
updates coordinates directly.

### 4.1 Attraction on graph edges

For each edge in the graph, the squared Euclidean distance between its
embedded coordinates is:

$$
d_{ij}^2=\sum_{k=1}^{q}(y_{ik}-y_{jk})^2.
$$

The estimator uses squared Euclidean distance, so $z_{ij}=d_{ij}^2$. The
logarithmic objective uses the pairwise edge probability:

$$
q_{ij}=\frac{1}{1+z_{ij}+\epsilon}.
$$

The attractive term is

$$
L_{\mathrm{attr}}=
\frac{1}{\sum_{(i,j)\in E}w_{ij}}\sum_{(i,j)\in E}
w_{ij}\bigl[-\log(q_{ij})\bigr]
=\frac{1}{\sum_{(i,j)\in E}w_{ij}}\sum_{(i,j)\in E}
w_{ij}\log(1+z_{ij}+\epsilon).
$$

Minimizing it brings graph-connected samples together. The MST-rank weight
applies to positive edges only.

For approximate FAMST graphs, the normalized rank-weighted objective can be
estimated by activating a rank $r$ edge once every $r$ epochs and using
rank-independent updates while it is active. Deterministic phases spread the
higher-rank updates across epochs. Exact Prim instead processes every edge in
every epoch and multiplies each attraction update by its explicit inverse-rank
weight $1/r_{ij}$. Both modes divide positive updates by
$\sum_{(i,j)\in E}1/r_{ij}$; negative updates are normalized by the eligible
sampled-pair count for that epoch.

This logarithmic objective is the only built-in attraction. It always acts on
squared Euclidean distances and uses the same edge weights and weight-sum
normalization described above.

### 4.2 Repulsion on sampled non-edges

For each active undirected positive edge, the implementation samples negative
targets for both endpoints. This makes sampling independent of the arbitrary
orientation used to store an edge. Targets are sampled uniformly from nodes
that are neither the source nor one of its graph neighbors. The
squared embedding distance for a sampled pair is:

$$
d_{uv}^2=\sum_{k=1}^{q}(y_{uk}-y_{vk})^2.
$$

For each sampled negative pair, the logistic margin loss is:

Here $z_{uv}=d_{uv}^2$ is the squared Euclidean embedding distance.

$$
L_{uv}^{-}=\operatorname{softplus}\left(\frac{m-z_{uv}}{\tau}\right),
$$

with `logistic_margin` $m$ and `logistic_temperature` $\tau$.
The negative loss is averaged over sampled pairs without MST-rank weights.
Nearby negative pairs incur a larger cost and are pushed apart. If a graph
has no eligible negative pairs, the repulsive term is zero for that step.

The combined normalized objective is

$$
L=(1-\lambda)L_{\mathrm{attr}}+\lambda L_{\mathrm{rep}},
$$

The parameter `lambda_rep` is the repulsion share $\lambda\in[0,1]$; the
attraction share is $1-\lambda$. The default $\lambda=0.5$ gives equal
weight to the two terms. The implementation normalizes the weighted
positive-edge losses by their graph-wide total weight; the negative term is
unchanged.

The estimator uses the logarithmic attraction and logistic repulsion described
above. The estimator optimizes sample coordinates directly.

## 5. Optimization procedure

For each epoch, the implementation selects edges whose rank schedule is due,
shuffles those edges, and processes each positive pair and its negative
samples sequentially. Linear learning-rate decay is applied across epochs.
The normalized mean gradient is rescaled by the sample count, with a
calibration factor chosen to match the former optimizer's default quality.
After each epoch it subtracts the coordinate mean, removing global translation
drift without changing pairwise differences. The Numba optimizer runs on CPU;
`device="auto"` and `device="cpu"` select CPU, while `device="mps"` is
unsupported. `batch_size` remains temporarily for estimator compatibility but
is deprecated and ignored. This SGD path preserves the objective's normalized
mean conventions, not Adam's update trajectory.

The estimator uses Euclidean distance for graph construction and squared
Euclidean distance in the embedding objective. Rank $r$ determines update
frequency; `graph_weights_` remains available as the corresponding $1/r$
diagnostic.

| Parameter | Default | Role |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `n_msts` | 15 | Number of edge-disjoint MSTs |
| `logistic_margin` | 1.0 | Squared-distance margin for logistic repulsion |
| `logistic_temperature` | 0.5 | Softness of the logistic repulsion; must be positive |
| `n_components` | 2 | Number of output dimensions |
| `n_epochs` | 200 | Number of rank-scheduled optimization epochs |
| `batch_size` | 4096 | Deprecated compatibility parameter; ignored |
| `learning_rate` | 0.05 | Base SGD learning rate, sample-scaled and linearly decayed |
| `negative_ratio` | 5 | Negative samples per endpoint of each positive edge |
| `lambda_rep` | 0.5 | Repulsion share; attraction uses `1 - lambda_rep` |
| `epsilon` | `1e-4` | Smoothing for the pairwise edge probability |
| `random_state` | 42 | Seed for initialization, shuffling, and sampling |
| `device` | `auto` | CPU Numba optimizer; MPS is unsupported |

The graph and pairwise distances are constructed on the CPU. The Torch
dependency remains for the separate inductive MLP and public reference loss
functions; it is not used by the transductive optimizer.

## 6. Practical use

Euclidean distance makes feature scale part of the model. Features with larger
numeric ranges can dominate graph construction, so inputs should be scaled
appropriately for the dataset. The gallery standardizes a stratified sample
before fitting. Labels in that gallery are used only to color plots; they are
not passed into the estimator's optimization.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from imste import IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder

digits = load_digits()
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(digits.data)

embedding = IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder(
    n_msts=10,
    n_components=2,
    random_state=42,
).fit_transform(X)
```

The returned array has shape `(n_samples, n_components)`. Coordinates are
centered after every optimization step, but their orientation, reflection, and
scale are not otherwise fixed. Interpret the embedding through relative
relationships and visual patterns, rather than as a coordinate system with
absolute units.

## 7. Computational cost

The exact `mst_method="prim"` backend constructs a pairwise distance matrix
requiring quadratic memory in the number of samples:

$$
O(n^2)
$$

Computing all distances scales with the number of samples squared times the
number of features:

$$
O(n^2p)
$$

The dense repeated MST construction takes:

$$
O(Rn^2)
$$

When all requested trees can be constructed, the graph contains:

$$
|E|=R(n-1)
$$

The default `mst_method="famst"` backend builds an approximate
nearest-neighbor graph. It samples up to `mst_representatives_per_component`
points per ANN component, builds an exact MST over those representatives, and
uses its cross-component edges to select unique component pairs for bridge
search and refinement. It then extracts edge-disjoint trees from the candidate
graph. For a fixed neighbor count and a small number of ANN components, its
graph storage grows approximately linearly with the number of rows. Its result
is approximate and does not guarantee the same trees as the complete Euclidean
graph. The implementation uses PyNNDescent and can increase the neighbor count,
within `mst_max_neighbors`, when the candidate graph lacks enough edge-disjoint
trees. This follows the FAMST approach by Almansoori and Telek (2025).

Optimization cost grows with the number of epochs, graph edges, negative ratio,
and output dimension. Let m denote the negative ratio and q the output
dimension. A rough per-epoch bound is:

$$
O(|E|(1+m)q).
$$

Large datasets can therefore require substantial memory and runtime even
when the final embedding has only two dimensions. Sampling a subset before
fitting is often practical for visualization.

## 8. Reproducibility and estimator behavior

`random_state` controls the initial coordinates, edge order within epochs, and
negative sampling. It makes CPU runs repeatable under the same software and
hardware configuration. Different compute backends or software versions may
produce small numerical differences.

The transductive `IteratedMinimumSpanningTreeEmbedder` follows the scikit-learn
`fit`, `fit_transform`, and `transform` interface. Since all coordinates are
optimized jointly, `transform` returns stored coordinates only for the exact
training matrix in its original row order. Use `imste.inductive.InductiveIMSTE`
when new rows need projections. This separate estimator fits an MLP to predict
the reference coordinates; its default has six hidden layers of 128 units and
0.1 dropout. It uses a 10% validation split, at least 100 epochs, and patience
of 20. The MLP is an extension around the core IMSTE objective, not part of the
embedding algorithm described here.

## 9. Limitations and interpretation

- Poor feature scaling can cause some dimensions to dominate Euclidean distances
  and produce a poor graph.
- The exact Prim backend uses dense pairwise distances and therefore limits
  practical sample counts through quadratic time and memory.
- The FAMST backend is approximate; quality depends on ANN recall and the
  candidate graph may fail to contain the requested number of edge-disjoint
  spanning trees under its configured neighbor cap.
- Repeated MSTs may become impossible before the requested rank because
  previously selected edges can disconnect the remaining graph.
- The embedding is stochastic and non-convex. A fixed seed supports
  reproducibility but does not establish that a result is unique or globally
  optimal.
- The repulsive term samples graph non-neighbors rather than modeling all
  non-edge pairs exactly; the sampled negative losses are unweighted.
- Output distances and axis values are not calibrated quantities. Rotation,
  reflection, and overall scale do not carry intrinsic meaning.
- The core IMSTE objective does not itself define an out-of-sample projection.
  `InductiveIMSTE` approximates it with an MLP trained on fitted coordinates.
  Labels are not used during either fit.

## 10. Summary

IMSTE constructs a rank-weighted union of edge-disjoint minimum
spanning trees and learns low-dimensional coordinates by balancing attraction
along graph edges against sampled repulsion between graph non-neighbors. The
approach is compact and easy to inspect, with its main tradeoff being the
quadratic cost of dense graph construction. It is best treated as an
exploratory embedding. Use exact Prim for smaller datasets where exact trees
matter, or FAMST when sparse approximate trees are an acceptable tradeoff for
larger datasets.
